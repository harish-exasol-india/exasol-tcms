# Variables required for terraform/tofu integration of an infrastructure preset with the Exasol Personal launcher.
# Ensure all deployment artifacts required for Exasol Personal launcher integration are written to this directory.
# These are:
#  deployment.json  -- meta information about the deployed infrastructure
#  secrets.json     -- secrets to access the database services
#  node_access.pem  -- an SSH key to access all deployed hosts
#
# A change here might break the interaction with the Exasol Personal launcher CLI.
# The Exasol Personal launcher expects some files to be present at the root of the deployment directory.
